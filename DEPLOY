Deploying Redmine on Arch Women's server.

There are two branches, public and private.
Public can be shared on GitHub.
Access to private must be restricted.

The flow of changes through merge commits,
upstream -> public -> private

Private is the branch deployed on the server.

Changes from upstream are merged into public during upgrade.

File should be readable by the web server.
The following need to be writable as well:
/log, /tmp, /files, and /public/plugin_assets

Other considerations, web server config and ruby deps, 
should be set accordingly.
