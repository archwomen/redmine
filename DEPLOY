Deploying Redmine on Arch Women's server.

The directory where redmine files are kept must 
be readable by the webserver. The directories, 
log, tmp, files, and public/plugin_assets must be 
writable.

Git needs to write to the files too (obviously). 
Have all files owned by git:http. The webserver 
runs as group http and git is part of group http. 
Have all directories setguid, like,
drwxr-sr-x git  http redmine.archwomen.org/

Set specific directories as writeable with,
chmod -R g+w "$wrkdir"/{log,tmp,files,public/plugin_assets}
It is not needed to setuid those as git ignores 
them.

Populate with,
GIT_WORK_TREE=/path/to/redmine/root git checkout -f

To upgrade, merge from upstream and follow, 
http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineUpgrade

Files containing secret information, such as 
passwords, are stored in redmine-private.

Files created on the server, such as logs, are 
copied to server-data-backup daily.

Other considerations, web server config and ruby deps, 
should be set accordingly.
